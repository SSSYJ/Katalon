### Team Procedures
#### Methods of communication
- Our main method of distant communication is through Slack to inform each other of team meetings, announcements, updates, reminders, or problems.
- Face-to-face group meetings to discuss the topic and brainstorm is preferred, especially when discussing ideas. It is more effective than discussing online, where a team member can express his opinion easily and receive feedback in a faster and smoother way. We can also ensure everyone is on the same page and that the message is received as intended. However, Zoom or Slack is also acceptable.
- Document sharing should be completed through [github group repo](https://github.ubc.ca/mds-cl-2021-22/katalon_project) or Slack group chat.

#### Meeting agenda
We will set up meetings beforehand and have a checklist about the things we are going to discuss during the meeting.

#### Project management
Use [project tab](https://github.ubc.ca/mds-cl-2021-22/katalon_project/projects/1) in Github repo to manage the tasks


### Team Participation
#### Strategies to ensure cooperation and equal distribution of tasks
- Face to face meeting is essential when working on any projects. It acts as a pushing factor in making everyone work harder and avoid slacking off. We will also set a deadline for each task, where the assigned person can ask for help if he/she has difficulties before it is too late.
- Tasks and work distribution will be managed as an entire unit and separated equally. Meanwhile, we also will take the strength of every member into consideration when splitting the work. Therefore,
- If a member feels overwhelmed with work or encounters problems, team members will reach out to help and come up with a solution.

#### Strategies for task maintenance
- When brainstorming, all group members are encouraged to participate and to discuss.
- We do not have a formal team leader. Actually, all members share responsibilities, benefit from the outcomes and are responsible for deliverables during the project.


### Team Decision-making
- Decisions will be made and discussed as a team
- Majority vote can be used in the team if the team cannot achieve an agreement.
- Once decided, all members should remain committed to any decision or tasks since all members have agreed to follow the decision.


### Team Work Expectation
- Individual attendance and participation at all team meetings will be required for all members
- Expected level of responsibility for fulfilling team assignments, timelines, and deadlines:
    - Responsibility for fulfilling team assignments, timelines, and deadlines will be required for all members.
    - In team meetings, members will check and confirm the progress of each member, verify that it is being completed on time, or work together to tackle issues certain members encounter.
- Each person is expected to spend at least 30 hours per week on the group project.
- When team members not available    
    We will be entirely democratic throughout the project because the general meetings are set to time that everyone is free and if some team members are not available with ad-hoc meetings, we will have post-meeting summaries posted on slack, so they can still catch up by reading summaries.  

### Team Code of Conduct
KEEP IT REAL!
